# S2L

Segmentation to Labels

## ⚠️ Warning
This repo isn't designed to be used standalone, I have created a helper [loader](https://github.com/kqih/s2l-loader) which can automatically set the entire enviornment up for you


## Manual fix.
You can fix by deleting the libs\roi_visualizer files
Delete the roi_visualizer.py file if you want CUDA, else delete roi_visualizer.cp311-win_amd64.pyd if you dont have CUDA
